**Heart Attack Prediction and Analysis**

*Overview*
This project focuses on predicting the likelihood of a heart attack using various machine learning models and analyzing the underlying data to gain insights. The analysis covers different aspects of data preprocessing, visualization, and modeling, using Python libraries.

*Project Structure*
1. Python Libraries
The following Python libraries were used in this project:
- pandas for data manipulation
- numpy for numerical operations
- matplotlib and seaborn for data visualization
- sklearn for machine learning models and preprocessing
- scipy for statistical analysis

2. Data Content
The dataset contains features related to heart health, including:

Age
Sex
Chest pain type (cp)
Resting blood pressure (trestbps)
Serum cholesterol (chol)
Fasting blood sugar (fbs)
Resting electrocardiographic results (restecg)
Maximum heart rate achieved (thalach)
Exercise-induced angina (exang)
ST depression (oldpeak)
Slope of the peak exercise ST segment (slope)
Number of major vessels (ca)
Thalassemia (thal)
Target variable indicating the presence or absence of heart disease

3. Read and Analyze Data
Initial steps involve reading the dataset and performing basic exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the distribution of the data.

4. Missing Value Analysis
Analyze the dataset for missing values and decide on strategies for handling them (e.g., imputation, removal).

5. Unique Value Analysis
Identify and analyze unique values in categorical features to understand their distribution and potential impact on modeling.

6. Categorical Feature Analysis
Explore and visualize categorical features to understand their relationship with the target variable using count plots and bar plots.

7. Numeric Feature Analysis
Analyze numerical features using summary statistics and visualizations like histograms and KDE plots to understand their distribution and potential outliers.

8. Standardization
Standardize numerical features to ensure that they have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1, which is essential for certain machine learning models.

9. Box Plot Analysis
Use box plots to visualize the spread of the data and identify potential outliers in numerical features.

10. Swarm Plot Analysis
Visualize the distribution of categorical data with respect to the target variable using swarm plots.

11. Cat Plot Analysis
Explore relationships between categorical features and the target variable using cat plots, which combine bar plots and scatter plots.

12. Correlation Analysis
Generate a correlation matrix to identify relationships between numerical features and the target variable, visualized using a heatmap.

13. Outlier Detection
Detect and handle outliers in the data that could adversely affect model performance.

14. Modelling
Several machine learning models were implemented to predict heart attack likelihood:

a. Encoding Categorical Columns
Convert categorical features into numerical values using techniques like one-hot encoding.

b. Scaling
Scale features to ensure uniformity, particularly for algorithms sensitive to feature magnitude.

c. Train/Test Split
Split the dataset into training and testing sets to evaluate model performance on unseen data.

d. Logistic Regression
Implement logistic regression for binary classification.

e. Naive Bayes
Use the Naive Bayes algorithm for probabilistic classification.

f. Random Forest Classifier
Apply the Random Forest classifier, an ensemble method, to improve prediction accuracy.

g. Extreme Gradient Boost
Use XGBoost, a powerful gradient boosting algorithm, for classification.

h. K-Nearest Neighbour
Implement the K-Nearest Neighbours algorithm to classify based on proximity to data points.

i. Decision Tree
Use a Decision Tree classifier to model decision-making processes.

j. Support Vector Machine
Apply Support Vector Machine (SVM) for robust classification with a clear margin of separation.

15. ROC Curves and Model Evaluation
Evaluate model performance using Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves and calculate metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Results
The models were evaluated based on their accuracy and other relevant metrics, with the ROC curves providing a visual representation of their performance.

Conclusion
This project demonstrated the effectiveness of various machine learning models in predicting heart attack likelihood. The analysis provided insights into the significance of different features and the importance of data preprocessing steps like standardization and outlier detection.
